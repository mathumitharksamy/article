Fashion of tomorrow

Due to store closings and work-from-home policies over the previous two years, fashion consumption decreased. This forced players in the fashion industry to move their business and order-placing to internet channels. To reach final buyers, they even shifted to virtual shows and exhibitions. The change enabled them to make it through the challenging times. As a result, they are becoming more dependent on digitalization and investing in various innovative technologies.
As a result of their realization that technology would continue to play an increasingly important role in society, purchasing cutting-edge technologies has moved to the top of their list of objectives. Strong rationale, as well as a strong necessity, are both used to steer growth. In the next ten years, the luxury fashion market might grow to more than $50 billion, with a $22.6 billion market for luxury NFTs, according to Morgan Stanley, a multinational investment bank and financial services provider based in the United States.
 
This seems fairly plausible considering how much the physical and digital worlds have recently converged. The metaverse's encroachment on fashion will be one of its unavoidable effects as this only picks up speed in the ensuing years. Many fashion firms have thus begun their path to become a part of the metaverse, motivated by a "future need."
Many people may find it challenging to understand the concept behind digital fashion since first it can appear pretty bizarre to buy or try on clothing that only exists in a virtual environment. Though many experts are starting to take the notion that  the Metaverse will drastically alter the future of fashion seriously now that this niche sector is continuing to grow rapidly.
For instance, a recent study indicated that apparel that exists only online is significantly more environmentally beneficial than its physical counterpart, generating 97% less CO2 and using about 3,300 liters less water per piece. Furthermore, there is evidence that suggests a brand's carbon footprint can be drastically reduced by 30% by switching from physical to digital samples while a product is being designed and developed.
Additionally, using digital clothing can be quite beneficial during the numerous processes that come before the actual physical creation of a garment. The environmental effect of a fashion item's full lifecycle can be significantly reduced by using these virtual goods, for instance, for modeling, sampling, and marketing before sending their physical counterparts into production.
Last but not least, digital clothing models can assist in reducing issues related to overproduction, which is commonly seen as a key hindrance in today's fashion business.
Some benefits of fashion metaverse 
Augmented fashion 
Purchasing clothes is much easier now, because of the presence of augmented reality in the metaverse fashion industry.

The Gucci Garden was a two-week-long art installation that offered a virtual house tour, several themed rooms, and plays areas inside of which users could test out and buy digital goods in 2021 on the gaming platform Roblox. The event's main objective was to increase brand awareness. On Twitter and Discord, 10KTF and the experimental company Gucci Vault have a relationship. This Gucci vault is a test-bed online environment where you may go into the metaverse, discover hand-selected brands, and study vintage fashions. The Gucci grail, one of its own NFTs, was unveiled on March 23. This NFT was made by wage-san and is a one-of-a-kind, bespoke design by Alessandro Michele.

A smaller designer's ability to enter the market will likewise be facilitated by the metaverse. Because of this, digital clothing is addressing the pressing demand for sustainability while also making the fashion business more accessible for sellers and purchasers. Fashion anticipates a bright digital future as the metaverse draws closer and the distinction between reality and virtual space becomes increasingly hazy.
